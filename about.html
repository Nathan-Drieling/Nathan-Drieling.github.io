                        Immediately after graduating from my high school, my college academics followed with two years at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. From the fall of 2012 to the fall of 2014, I went to both the Harrison County and the Jackson County Campuses. While attending, I persued (but did not attain) a Bachelor of Science.

                        In the spring of 2015, I transfered to the University of Southern Mississippi 
                        and switched my major to Computer Science where 
                        I graduated with a <strong>3.0 GPA</strong> average in the spring of 2019.
                        Here, I learned various programming langauges and technologies and had many great instructors. 
                        I enjoyed all my coursework of which were <em>Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, 
                        Intro to Artificial Intelligence, Database Management Systems, Operating Systems, 
                        Theory of Programming Languages and Algorithms, Software Engineering I and Software Engineering II</em>.

                        I used the <strong>C++</strong> programming language for most of my main core courses. 
                        However, I also used <strong>Java</strong> for <em>Object Oriented Programming</em>, <strong>MySQL and SQL</strong> for my <em>Database Management Systems class</em>, 
                        and even tinkered with some <strong>Python</strong> for my <em>
                        Theory of Programming Languages class
                        </em>. I also was 
                        exposed to using <strong>Agile Software Development</strong> and <em>SCRUM</em> from my
                        <em>Software Engineering I</em> and <em>Software Engineering II</em> Capstone classes.

                        In the summer of 2018, while still at USM, I had the unique opprotunity to do a three month internship at <strong>NASA John C. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi</strong> as per a recommendation by one of my instructors.
                        The internship project specifically dealt with helping the <em>National Data Buoy Center</em> 
                        and <em>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</em> main operation for gathering weather data for the public use. Here, I gained my first real world software development experience and what it would be like to work in the software development industry.

                        For my project, I created a database back end
                        using <strong>MariaDB</strong> and testing it using the <strong>Eclipse IDE</strong> for the Java Programming language. In addition, I also created supporting charts and graphs of bouy coordinates using <strong>MATLAB</strong>. In my last week, I gave a presentation in front of the NDBC staff where I demonstrated some of the database functionalities along with all supporting front end test code and any other graphs or charts which I had produced.

                        In November of 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I managed to secure a fully remote (and then hybrid) full time software development position in Metairie, Louisiana, with a federal government contracting company based in Juneau, Alaska called Goldbelt Inc. While employed with Goldbelt (and its subsidiary - Goldbelt Nighthawk), I worked on a personell management software called My Navy Assignment- as part of a continuing contract for the United States Navy.
